# Micro-Bit-Home-Comms
Simple home communication system that uses BBC Microbits. I have attached a word Doc that shows all the different commands that I have already coded onto the MicroBit hex file. These are easily changeable using makecode or in the hex file.
If you download the hex file you can put it straight onto your micro bit or you can open it using https://makecode.microbit.org/. This is where it can be edited using blocks or using Java Script.
At the moment I cannot find the proper hex file. I will upload it asap
# Enjoy
